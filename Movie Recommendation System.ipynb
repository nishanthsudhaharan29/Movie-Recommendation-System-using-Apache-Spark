Instead, we need to train again the model but including the new user preferences in order to compare them with other users in the dataset. That is, the recommender needs to be trained every time we have new user ratings (although a single model can be used by multiple users of course!). This makes the process expensive, and it is one of the reasons why scalability is a problem (and Spark a solution!). Once we have our model trained, we can reuse it to obtain top recomendations for a given user or an individual rating for a particular movie.

    "Spark's MLlib library provides scalable data analytics through a rich set of methods. Its Alternating Least Squares implementation for Collaborative Filtering is one that fits perfectly in a recommendation engine. Due to its very nature, collaborative filtering is a costly procedure since requires updating its model when new user preferences arrive. Therefore, having a distributed computation engine such as Spark to perform model computation is a must in any real-world recommendation engine like the one we have built here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial we have described how to build a model using Spark, how to perform some parameter selection using a reduced dataset, and how to update the model every time that new user preferences come in. Additionally, we have explained how the recommender is used in different situations and how its results are joined with product metadata (e.g. movie titles) in order to present its results in a proper way."
